        		<h1>Hi there, My name is Kathy!</h1>
				<p>I am a 62 year old woman who has enjoyed a fruitful career.  I feel very blessed to have worked before computers were part of our working environment.  Once computers became part of our working environment, I was like a sponge and explored all that I could about how these machines made our work more efficient and accurate.</p>
